# Deploy Nodes for Minetest

Craftable nodes that when placed turn into shapes or structures.


## Features

- easy to use - no chat commands, just nice easy structures that you can build by crafting and placing nodes
- lightweight - there are no ABMs, the nodes are created using after_place_node() in the node definitions
- grief-resistant - before nodes deploy a check is run to ensure that only air exists in the new area
- server friendly - all players can create impressive structures easily
